## Pseudocode
- Create a div for the rules, score, letters, and answer or Create buttons of the letters for the user to click??
- If buttons for letters - change the color of the already guessed letters or make them no longer clickable or both??
- Set the correct guessed letters to stay visible during the game
- Create an input button for the user to insert their guesses
- Display the hint to the hidden word
- Add event listeners to the input button
- Delete the users input after each submission
- Set the pinata to move up/further away with every wrong guess and down/closer with every correct guess
- Set a couple pieces of candy to fall with each lowering of the pinata
- The pinata needs to explode after the user  guesses the correct guess   
- If the user loses the pinata should be to high for the bat to hit and it should “swoosh” under the pinata
- Set the win and lose conditions


## Next Steps
### Planned future enhancement are:
- Add additional media features such as a bat swing on the incorrect guesses. 
- Add additional celebration media upon winning the game.
- Add additional words in a word bank to allow repeated play.
