- Set the pinata to move up/further away with every wrong guess and down/closer with every correct guess
- Set a couple pieces of candy to fall with each lowering of the pinata
- The pinata needs to explode after the user  guesses the correct guess   
- If the user loses the pinata should be to high for the bat to hit and it should “swoosh” under the pinata
